[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions/workflows/linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter)
![CI](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)


## Purpose
This action identifies and reports stale repositories, that is repositories with no activity within a certain time period. The goal is to clean up organizations.

## Alternatives
Have a look at [actions/stale-repos](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/stale-repos).
If it does what you need it to do, it's probably a better choice! This action is not working and yet, and maintanance is questionable!

If you are looking to identify stale pull requests and issues, check out [actions/stale](https://github.com/actions/stale)

## History
This action was created due to insufficient features of [actions/stale-repos](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/stale-repos).
It's a separate action and not an extension, since the purpose was only secondary in nature.
The primary purpose was to learn creating actions and learn JavaScript / TypeScript.

## How to use
Currently Unknown... as it's not yet working!!
